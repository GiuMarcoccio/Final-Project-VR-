## Merge Sorting Game

### Problem Statementtt

Data Structures serve as the foundations for some fields of computer science and are one of the essential skills for programmers to be familiar with. Part of the problem is that many students find the material particularly abstract, challenging, and boring. This requires the use of approaches and tools to improve student engagement and performance.

We believe that interactive educational games are a powerful tool to encourage students' engagement by adding tangible experiences. As students who study data structures, we decided to design tools to help students better understand abstract sorting algorithms.We believe that the interactive visualized merge sort algorithm in our platform will help students understand the concepts and logic behind it faster and drive them to keep exploring. 

Trial and error is an integral part of the learning process. Our vision is to provide data structures students with the opportunity to experience it firsthand while performing the algorithm step by step.
